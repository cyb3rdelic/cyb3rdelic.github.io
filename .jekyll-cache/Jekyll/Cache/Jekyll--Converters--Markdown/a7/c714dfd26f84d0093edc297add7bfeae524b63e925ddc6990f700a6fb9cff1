I"à<p>Hey all. I was tasked with setting up a new NagiosXI instance and we needed a dashboard for the office. I found one, NagiosTV, which is super clean and easy to use. The only problem I ran into was creating a dashboard that was able to be accessed without credentials. I ended up using MK Livestatus to fetch the data to display on our big screen.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ll show you how to do this here, just because it took a bit to get it figured out. But first, some credits:</p>

<p>Livestatus now resides with CheckMK, Iâ€™ll post the specific download link.

<b>Note:</b> I donâ€™t believe they are releasing any more version of Livestatus. The last version I see is 1.5.0p24. Newer releases only offer Checkmk with OMD.

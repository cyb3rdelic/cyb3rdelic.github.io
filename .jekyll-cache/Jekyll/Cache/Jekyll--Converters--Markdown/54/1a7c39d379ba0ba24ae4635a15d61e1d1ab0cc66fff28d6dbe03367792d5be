Welcome to my blog! I'm using this to track projects I work on, fixes I find, and general cool stuff. I hope you find something helpful here.

<p>I’m a system administrator early in my career, looking to continuing my education while having fun learning. I’m interested in computer security, cyber threat intelligence, and general systems administration.</p>

<p>I’m also interested in learning programming more in depth, as well as getting into devops. It seems to be the future and I don’t want to be left behind. Stay with me for more fun stuff!</p>

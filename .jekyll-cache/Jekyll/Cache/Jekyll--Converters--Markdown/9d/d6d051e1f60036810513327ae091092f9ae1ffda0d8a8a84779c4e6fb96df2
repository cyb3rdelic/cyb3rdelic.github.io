I"b<p>Hey all. I was tasked with setting up a new NagiosXI instance and we needed a dashboard for the office. I found one, NagiosTV, which is super clean and easy to use. The only problem I ran into was creating a dashboard that was able to be accessed without credentials. I ended up using MK Livestatus to fetch the data to display on our big screen.</p>

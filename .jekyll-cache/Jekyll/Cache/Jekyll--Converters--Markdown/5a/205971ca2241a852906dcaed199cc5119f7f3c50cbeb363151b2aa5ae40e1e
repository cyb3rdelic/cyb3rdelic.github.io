I"œ<p>Spent some time yesterday working on a Citrix issue that I wasnâ€™t sure I could fix. It turns out it was a lot more simple than I thought. I just got a bit flustered when working on it and needed to sleep on it. Iâ€™m going to outline what I did this morning to get it fixed up.</p>

<p>Issue: RDP sessions from Citrix Storefront werenâ€™t launching like they used to. Iâ€™m fairly new to this company, so this is my first time using Citrix. Additionally, Iâ€™m unsure how long it had been since they used these specific RDP session links. When clicking on the RDP link box, it either didnâ€™t load at all with no explanation, or it popped up this warning box with literally no error information. See below:</p>

<p>After searching the internet I only found on slightly helpful piece of information, even though it was a bit dated. <a href="https://support.citrix.com/article/CTX127051">How to Publish a Remote Desktop with a Custom Configuration: CTX127051</a></p>

<p>This page went through the creation of and RDP file and how to publish it using Storefront. This help article helped, but not fully.  Iâ€™ll show you the adjustment I had to make that wasnâ€™t that straightforward, at least for me.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s the old configuration. As you can see the command and arguments are all on one line.

<p>Hereâ€™s the new configuration. The command needed to be broken out from the single line like it used to be.

<p>And thatâ€™s all it took! I believe that it happened because the Citrix instance was upgraded and those links had not been used since. Either way, itâ€™s back up and working again. On to the next thing! I hope if someone comes across this, it helps.</p>
